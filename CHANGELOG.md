# Changelog

All notable changes to Brokoli are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project loosely follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **SODP realtime stack** — `/api/ws` now speaks the State-Oriented Data
  Protocol ([orkestri/SODP](https://github.com/orkestri/SODP)) instead of a
  hand-rolled JSON event hub. Binary msgpack framing, per-key subscriptions,
  delta fanout, and reconnect-resilient via the protocol's `RESUME` frame.
  See [`docs/realtime.md`](docs/realtime.md) for the architecture, key model,
  wire format, and rate limits.
- **`pkg/sodp`** — new in-process Go implementation of SODP v0.1: versioned
  state store with ring-buffer delta log, per-org tenant-isolated fanout bus,
  per-session rate limiting and watch caps, JWT auth, eviction goroutine for
  completed run state. 50+ unit tests, 12 integration tests against a real
  WebSocket, and a cross-language test that runs `@sodp/client@0.2.1` from
  Node.js against the live server.
- **`api/eventbus_bridge_test.go`** — distributed-mode test: worker publishes
  to `EventBus` (in-memory in OSS, Redis pub/sub in enterprise), API pod
  subscribes and forwards events into the SODP fanout. The bus → bridge → SODP
  path is the only way events cross pod boundaries in distributed deployments.
- **`api/ws_jwt_context_test.go`** — regression test for the JWT-on-WebSocket
  context-propagation fix below.
- **Calendar redesign** — replaced the previous flat-grid heatmap with a
  GitHub-style horizontal layout (weeks as columns, days as rows). Each day
  cell shows a vertical color split sized by the actual success / running /
  failed proportions instead of going solid red on any failure. Activity
  intensity is log-scaled relative to the busiest day in the range. Includes
  a sparkline trend strip, muted data-viz palette local to the page, and a
  proportional detail bar with per-day success rate.

### Changed

- **WebSocket protocol on `/api/ws` is now binary msgpack, not JSON.** Any
  external tooling that opened `/api/ws` and parsed JSON event objects must
  switch to a SODP client. Reference clients available for TypeScript
  (`@sodp/client`), Python (`sodp`), and Java (`io.sodp:sodp-client`), or
  speak the wire format directly using the schemas documented in
  `docs/realtime.md`. The Brokoli UI handles this transparently via
  `ui/src/lib/ws.ts` — no UI-side migration required when upgrading.
- **`@sodp/client@^0.2.0`** is now a runtime UI dependency. Pinned in
  `ui/package.json`. Self-hosters who build the UI from source will pull it
  automatically via `npm install`.
- **`api.Hub` removed.** The pre-SODP `Hub` type and `handlers_ws.go` were
  deleted. `RegisterRoutes` now takes `*sodp.Server` instead of `*Hub`.
  Internal callers only.
- **`bridgeCh` buffer is 512 events.** Engine events that overflow it are
  dropped with a warning log line, instead of stalling the engine's event
  channel. This is a deliberate backpressure choice for high-frequency log
  events; the cap is sized for typical workloads but is not yet load-tested
  at thousands of events per second.
- **Calendar palette is now muted** (forest sage / terracotta / steel blue
  inspired by Observable's data-viz palettes) for large color regions where
  the global bright `--success`/`--failed` were "hot." The global theme is
  unchanged — every other status indicator across the app still uses the
  vivid colors where high saturation reads correctly at small sizes.

### Fixed

- **Multi-tenant isolation collapsed on the WebSocket path.** The HTTP
  `JWTAuth` middleware validated tokens on `/api/ws` upgrades but did not
  propagate `claims` or `org_id` into the request context. The SODP server
  read claims from the context to enforce per-session tenant filtering, found
  nothing, and treated every authenticated WebSocket session as the default
  org — meaning users from `org=acme` would receive realtime events from
  `org=widgets` and vice versa. The non-WebSocket branch of the same
  middleware was correct; the WebSocket branch is now aligned with it.
  `api/ws_jwt_context_test.go` locks this in as a regression test.
- **`Pipelines.svelte` run counts reset to 1 after each WebSocket event.**
  Two stacked bugs: the WS event handler replaced the cached pipeline-runs
  entry with a fresh single-element list missing the `_total/_success/...`
  counter fields; and the Run-button click handler did its own optimistic
  REST refetch that wiped the same fields a millisecond earlier. The handler
  now mutates the cached counters in place and tracks `seenStarted` run IDs
  to handle late-arriving terminal events; the click handler no longer
  refetches.
- **`Connections.svelte` and `Variables.svelte` empty-state CTAs were
  no-ops.** Both pages set a phantom `showCreateModal` variable that didn't
  exist; the actual modal state is `showModal`. The CTAs now call the proper
  `openCreate()` handler that initializes the form and opens the modal.
- **`RunIndicator` panel overflowed off-screen.** The expanded "Recent Runs"
  panel was anchored to the floating button's `left: 0`, so a 300px-wide
  panel attached to a button at `right: 24px` clipped past the viewport. Now
  anchored to `right: 0` so it expands leftward into the page.
- **WebSocket connection burned through retries before login.** `App.svelte`
  created the SODP client unconditionally on mount, before the user had
  authenticated. The client hit `503` (open mode) or `401` (locked mode) for
  the first 4-8 attempts and then sat in a 30-second backoff loop, missing
  events that fired immediately after login. Connection lifecycle is now
  driven reactively from `$authUser`: open on login, close on logout. No
  retries are wasted against an unauthenticated session.
- **`DecodeFrame` rejected bodyless frames.** Heartbeat and ack frames with
  a nil body decoded into an empty `msgpack.RawMessage`, which the body
  decoder treated as EOF. `DecodeFrame` now treats `len(raw[3]) == 0` as a
  nil body explicitly.
- **`sodp.Server` had a concurrent-write race on the WebSocket connection.**
  Handler responses (HELLO, STATE_INIT, RESULT, ERROR) wrote directly to the
  connection while the write-pump goroutine also wrote, which `gorilla/websocket`
  doesn't support. All handler responses now go through the session's `Send`
  channel; the write pump is the sole writer to the connection.

### Security

- The WebSocket JWT-context fix above is a security fix in addition to a
  correctness fix. The data leak only manifested in multi-tenant deployments
  with multiple orgs, but in those deployments it was complete: every realtime
  event visible to any org was visible to every other org. Single-tenant /
  community-mode deployments were never affected.
